# 🚀 TaskFlow – Full-Stack Productivity App

## 📖 Description
TaskFlow is a full-stack productivity and task management app built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It allows users to:
- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks by categories
- Track progress with a clean UI
- Sync data across devices

This project was built as part of my journey at **100Devs** to strengthen my full-stack development skills.
